⚡ Key Concepts Practiced

Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, objects, constructors, methods

Collections: Dynamic storage using ArrayList

File Handling: Save/load objects with ObjectOutputStream / ObjectInputStream

Exception Handling: Safe input with try-catch

Menu-Driven Programs: Loops and switch-case for user navigation

🌟 Future Enhancements

GUI version using Swing or JavaFX

Database integration using JDBC + MySQL

Login system (Admin/Student roles)
